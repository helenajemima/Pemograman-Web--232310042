    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h1>

    <p>There's no question that software programming is a hot career right now. 
        The <a>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> projects 21 percent 
        growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four 
        times the average for all occupations. What's more, the median annual pay 
        for a software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the 
        median pay for all U.S. workers.
    </p>

    <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and 
        types of software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and 
        it's often beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of 
        software programming can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with 
        no prior programming experience.
    </p>

    <p>The <a class="blue-text"><u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u></a>
        at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want to transition 
        into computer science from another field of study.
    </p>
    <p><i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come 
        out as software engineers,” </i>says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer science
         programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. <i>“We focus on math, programming, and a variety of 
         computer science and engineering concepts.”</i>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: right;">Whether you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know which 
        languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages of 2022 based 
        on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average annual salary for 
        those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.
